## FPGA Image Decompressor project

### Objective

The main objective of this project is to design an image decompressor using Verilog and digital hardware design methodologies. With the compressed data provided for a 320*240 image, the digital system is able to process those data, recover the image back to its original size and save the output image back onto a hardware drive.

With the finite state machine designd, the implementatin is able to achieve a 93.5% utilization of onboard multipliers to perform multiplication and division. 
### Technologies Used

This project uses various techonologies and software:
- Altera DE2 Board
- ModelSim Simulation Tool
- Intel Quartus
